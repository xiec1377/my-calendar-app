### Calendar app
Just a simple calendar app that allows you to create, edit and delete events in monthly, weekly and daily view. You can also filter events based on calendar.

This app was built with `Next.js` framework (`React` + `Node.js`) using Tailwind CSS, big react calendar, shadcn/ui for the frontend, and Prisma with PostgreSQL for the backend.

```
npm run dev
```

```

To open local Prisma web server to view database:

```
