### Calendar app

Just a simple calendar app that allows you to create, edit and delete events in monthly, weekly and daily view. You can also filter events based on calendar. See [demo](https://my-calendar-2c4yzfxxr-xiec1377s-projects.vercel.app/).

This app was built with `Next.js` framework (`React` + `Node.js`) using Tailwind CSS, big react calendar, shadcn/ui for the frontend, and Prisma with PostgreSQL for the backend (Prisma Studio for hosting local db in dev and Neon for hosting prod db).

To start server:

```
npm run dev
```

To regenerate Prisma client for database:

```
npx prisma dev
```

To open local Prisma web server to view database in dev:

```
npx prisma studio
```
